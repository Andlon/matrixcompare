//! This "minimal" crate is just a means of testing in CI that the most barebones
//! example involving `matrixcompare` compiles. This is intended to prevent an issue like
//! that reported in [issue #3](https://github.com/Andlon/matrixcompare/issues/3) from
//! happening again.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
